## Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was implementing a program in Haskell
that by nature is stateful (Keeping track of dirs and current dirs).
This was hard because in Haskell you cannot make mutable data, in 
other words everything was a constant. Another big challenge was
that I hadn't used ByteStrings in Haskell before where in this
particular problem I was constantly using them. Those two things 
were the main challenges I faced while doing the assignment.
